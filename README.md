# WaterlooWorks Flash Next

WaterlooWorks Flash Next is a planned WaterlooWorks wrapper that automatically fetches the latest job postings and analyzes their key details, helping students find relevant opportunities faster.

## The idea

Instead of opening every posting to compare job details, students can browse a clearer, more searchable view of WaterlooWorks listings.

The wrapper aims to extract and organize information such as:

- **Salary:** Compensation amounts, ranges, and pay periods when available.
- **Keywords:** Technologies, skills, responsibilities, and other relevant terms.
- **Location:** Where a role is based.
- **Work arrangement:** Remote, hybrid, or in-person status.

Missing or ambiguous details should be clearly marked rather than presented as confirmed facts.

## Planned workflow

1. Fetch the latest postings from WaterlooWorks through an authorized access method.
2. Analyze each posting and normalize its key fields.
3. Present the results in an easy-to-scan interface with search and filtering.
4. Link back to the original posting for full details and applications.

## Backend stack

- **Python + uv:** Backend development, dependency management, and environment setup.
- **Pydantic:** Typed data models and validation for job postings and extracted fields.
- **Playwright:** Browser automation for complex scraping flows.
- **Direct HTTP requests:** Fast data retrieval where browser automation is unnecessary.

Prefer direct requests when practical, using Playwright for flows that require browser interaction or rendering. The HTTP client and scraping details are still to be decided.

## Frontend stack

- **React + Vite:** Frontend UI and development/build tooling.
- **HeroUI v3:** UI component library.
- **Framer Motion:** Animations and transitions.

## Proposed project structure

A single repository with separate backend and frontend applications. The initial scaffold implements the placeholder frontend, Python package, tests, and quality tooling. The tree below also includes planned modules; unimplemented directories and files will be added only when needed.

```

- Keep scraping, analysis, and UI concerns separate. Promote verified experimental work into the backend rather than depending on `.experiment/` at runtime.
- Tooling: npm workspaces with a root `package-lock.json`, pytest for Python, Vitest and Testing Library for React, mypy for Python type checks, and GitHub Actions for CI. E2E tooling remains undecided.
- Backend API framework, persistence, scheduling, and runtime entry points: **Placeholder — to be decided.** No routes, schemas, or storage layout are assumed yet.
- Private runtime data and authentication state stay out of Git and container images. Their storage and Docker volume configuration: **Placeholder — to be defined.**
- Test directories do not imply mock datasets or fixtures; follow the placeholder policy below.

## Deployment model

The project will be public, but each running instance is intended for **one person only**, not as a shared multi-user service. Credentials, personal data, and fetched postings should remain private to that instance and out of the public repository.

The deployment goal is to start the service with a single Docker Compose command after initial configuration, with two profiles:

- **`dev`:** Local development.
- **`prod`:** Normal self-hosted use.

The initial Compose configuration runs **only the placeholder frontend**:

```sh
# Development: http://localhost:5173
docker compose --profile dev up --build

# Production: http://localhost:8080
docker compose --profile prod up -d --build
```

Both profiles bind to localhost. Development mounts frontend source for hot reload; rebuild after dependency or configuration changes. Backend services, private storage, and authenticated retrieval remain placeholders until their runtime design is established. Container execution requires a running Docker daemon.

## Local setup and checks

Requirements: Node.js 22.22.3 or newer compatible LTS, npm, and uv. The backend pins Python 3.12, which uv can provision. Use Docker with Compose for container startup.

```sh
# From the repository root
npm ci
npm run dev
```

```sh
# In a separate terminal, from the repository root
cd backend
uv sync --locked
```

Quality checks:

```sh
# From the repository root: formatting, linting, types, tests, build
npm run check

# Backend checks
cd backend
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
uv build
```

Use `npm run format` and, within `backend/`, `uv run ruff format .` to apply formatting. Playwright browser binaries are not needed for these checks; install Chromium with `uv run playwright install chromium` from `backend/` when guided browser exploration begins. No login or data fetching is performed during setup.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution and privacy rules.

## Agent workspace

The `.experiment/` folder is a local scratch workspace where agents can run quick tests and clone or inspect other repositories. It must always remain in `.gitignore`; its contents must not be committed.

## Guided scraping development

Development will begin with an agent running an interactive uv-managed Python shell in `.experiment/test/`. You will provide screenshots and text to guide the agent through WaterlooWorks, from login to fetching information, and specify what to record along the way.

The agent will turn the verified steps into a reproducible script. A flowchart in [docs/scraping-workflow.md](docs/scraping-workflow.md) will map how Playwright moves through WaterlooWorks itself: verified pages, browser actions, navigation transitions, and information retrieval points. It describes the automation’s path through the platform, not our development process, and will be filled in as we explore.

## Engineering standards

- **Conventional Commits:** Use the Conventional Commits format for commit messages, with appropriate types, optional scopes, and breaking-change markers.
- **Test-driven development (TDD):** Write a failing test for the intended behavior, implement the minimum needed to pass, then refactor. Cover fixes with regression tests.
- **Formatting and linting:** Use Prettier for frontend code and supported documentation/configuration formats, ESLint for frontend linting, and Ruff for Python formatting and linting.
- **Type safety:** Use TypeScript with strict checks for the React frontend and type annotations with a static type checker for Python. Pydantic provides runtime validation, not a replacement for static checks. Use mypy in strict mode for Python.
- **Quality gates:** Require formatting, linting, type checks, tests, and applicable build checks to pass in CI before merging. GitHub Actions runs these checks; the repository owner must enable branch protection to make them required before merging.
- **Testing boundaries:** Keep routine tests deterministic and independent of live WaterlooWorks access. Authenticated integration checks must be explicitly opted into and keep credentials and private data out of logs and artifacts. Follow the placeholder policy: do not add mock data or invented platform behavior.
- **Maintainability and security:** Keep changes focused, handle errors explicitly, validate external inputs, commit dependency lockfiles, and never commit secrets or private data.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic markup, keyboard-accessible interactions, and reduced-motion support in the frontend.

Formatting, linting, type checks, baseline tests, and CI configuration are implemented. Conventional Commits are currently review-enforced; platform-specific tests and E2E checks await verified behavior.

## Placeholder policy

Use placeholders for anything not yet provided, verified, or implemented. Do not introduce mock data, sample postings, fabricated API responses, or speculative platform flows. This applies across documentation, scraping, data models, backend, frontend, and deployment configuration. Keep confirmed technology choices and requirements; fill in unknown details only as they are established.

## Status

Initial scaffold only: a placeholder UI, an importable Python package, and development tooling. No WaterlooWorks automation, job models, mock data, API, or persistence is implemented. Fetching details, update frequency, analysis approach, and the functional interface are still to be discussed.

Access should respect WaterlooWorks policies and protect students’ credentials and personal data. This is an independent project, not an official WaterlooWorks product.
